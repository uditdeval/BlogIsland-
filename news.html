<h1> How to Make a Classic Spaghetti Bolognese</h1><br/>

Welcome back to [Your Cooking Blog Name]! Today, we're taking a trip to Italy in the comfort of your own kitchen to whip up a timeless favorite - Spaghetti Bolognese. This hearty and flavorful pasta dish is perfect for family dinners, date nights, or whenever you're craving a comforting meal. Let's dive right in!<br/>

<h2> Ingredients:</h2><br/>

- 1 lb (450g) ground beef<br/>
- 1 medium onion, finely chopped<br/>
- 2 cloves garlic, minced<br/>
- 1 carrot, finely chopped<br/>
- 1 celery stalk, finely chopped<br/>
- 1 can (28 oz) crushed tomatoes<br/>
- 2 tablespoons tomato paste<br/>
- 1/2 cup red wine (optional)<br/>
- 1/2 cup whole milk<br/>
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano<br/>
- 1 teaspoon dried basil<br/>
- Salt and pepper to taste<br/>
- Olive oil<br/>
- 1 lb (450g) spaghetti<br/>
- Grated Parmesan cheese (for serving)<br/>
- Fresh basil leaves (for garnish)<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Instructions:</h2><br/>

<h3> 1. Sauté the Aromatics:</h3><br/>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Start by heating a tablespoon of olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the chopped onion, garlic, carrot, and celery. Sauté until the vegetables are softened and the onions become translucent, about 5 minutes.<br/>
  
<h3> 2. Brown the Ground Beef:</h3><br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Push the sautéed vegetables to the side of the skillet and add the ground beef to the other side. Break up the meat with a wooden spoon and cook until it's browned and no longer pink.<br/>
   
 <h3>3. Combine and Season:</h3><br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mix the browned beef with the sautéed vegetables. Stir in the tomato paste, dried oregano, and dried basil. Season generously with salt and pepper. <br/>
   
<h3> 4. Add the Liquid:</h3><br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pour in the red wine (if using) and let it simmer for a few minutes to reduce slightly. Then, add the crushed tomatoes and whole milk. Stir well to combine all the ingredients.<br/>
   
<h3> 5. Simmer:</h3><br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reduce the heat to low, cover the skillet, and let the sauce simmer for at least 30 minutes, but longer if you have time (1-2 hours is ideal). This slow simmering allows the flavors to meld and intensify.<br/>
   
<h3>6. Cook the Spaghetti:</h3><br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the sauce is simmering, cook the spaghetti according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside.<br/>
   
<h3> 7. Serve:</h3><br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the sauce has reached your desired consistency, taste and adjust the seasoning if needed. Spoon a generous amount of the sauce over a serving of cooked spaghetti. Garnish with fresh basil leaves and grated Parmesan cheese.<br/>
   
<h3> 8. Enjoy:</h3><br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Serve your classic Spaghetti Bolognese hot and enjoy this comforting Italian masterpiece!<br/>
   
<h3> Tips:</h3><br/>

- If you prefer a vegetarian version, you can substitute the ground beef with textured vegetable protein (TVP) or finely chopped mushrooms for a rich, meaty texture.<br/>
- Don't forget to sprinkle extra Parmesan cheese on top before digging in—it adds a delightful salty kick.<br/>
- Leftovers can be refrigerated and taste even better the next day, so make extra for lunch!<br/>
<br/>
That's it for today's recipe! We hope you enjoyed making and savoring this classic Spaghetti Bolognese. Stay tuned for more delicious recipes and culinary adventures from [Your Cooking Blog Name]. Buon appetito!<br/>
