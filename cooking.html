## How to Make a Classic Spaghetti Bolognese

Welcome back to [Your Cooking Blog Name]! Today, we're taking a trip to Italy in the comfort of your own kitchen to whip up a timeless favorite - Spaghetti Bolognese. This hearty and flavorful pasta dish is perfect for family dinners, date nights, or whenever you're craving a comforting meal. Let's dive right in!

### Ingredients:

- 1 lb (450g) ground beef
- 1 medium onion, finely chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 carrot, finely chopped
- 1 celery stalk, finely chopped
- 1 can (28 oz) crushed tomatoes
- 2 tablespoons tomato paste
- 1/2 cup red wine (optional)
- 1/2 cup whole milk
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon dried basil
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Olive oil
- 1 lb (450g) spaghetti
- Grated Parmesan cheese (for serving)
- Fresh basil leaves (for garnish)

### Instructions:

#### 1. Sauté the Aromatics:

   Start by heating a tablespoon of olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the chopped onion, garlic, carrot, and celery. Sauté until the vegetables are softened and the onions become translucent, about 5 minutes.

#### 2. Brown the Ground Beef:

   Push the sautéed vegetables to the side of the skillet and add the ground beef to the other side. Break up the meat with a wooden spoon and cook until it's browned and no longer pink.

#### 3. Combine and Season:

   Mix the browned beef with the sautéed vegetables. Stir in the tomato paste, dried oregano, and dried basil. Season generously with salt and pepper. 

#### 4. Add the Liquid:

   Pour in the red wine (if using) and let it simmer for a few minutes to reduce slightly. Then, add the crushed tomatoes and whole milk. Stir well to combine all the ingredients.

#### 5. Simmer:

   Reduce the heat to low, cover the skillet, and let the sauce simmer for at least 30 minutes, but longer if you have time (1-2 hours is ideal). This slow simmering allows the flavors to meld and intensify.

#### 6. Cook the Spaghetti:

   While the sauce is simmering, cook the spaghetti according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside.

#### 7. Serve:

   Once the sauce has reached your desired consistency, taste and adjust the seasoning if needed. Spoon a generous amount of the sauce over a serving of cooked spaghetti. Garnish with fresh basil leaves and grated Parmesan cheese.

#### 8. Enjoy:

   Serve your classic Spaghetti Bolognese hot and enjoy this comforting Italian masterpiece!

### Tips:

- If you prefer a vegetarian version, you can substitute the ground beef with textured vegetable protein (TVP) or finely chopped mushrooms for a rich, meaty texture.
- Don't forget to sprinkle extra Parmesan cheese on top before digging in—it adds a delightful salty kick.
- Leftovers can be refrigerated and taste even better the next day, so make extra for lunch!

That's it for today's recipe! We hope you enjoyed making and savoring this classic Spaghetti Bolognese. Stay tuned for more delicious recipes and culinary adventures from [Your Cooking Blog Name]. Buon appetito!
